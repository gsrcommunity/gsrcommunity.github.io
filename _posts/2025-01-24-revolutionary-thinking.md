## What is Revolutionary Thinking?

Revolutionary thinking involves radically new or innovative ideas that go beyond established procedures or principles. It challenges conventions, reimagines the status quo, and seeks unprecedented solutions to address societal challenges and individual growth.

Revolutionary thinking requires courage and a willingness to step into the unknown. It challenges deeply ingrained assumptions and opens the door to transformative ideas that redefine the way we live, work, and interact with the world. It invites us to explore perspectives that might initially seem impossible and to turn those possibilities into reality.

True revolutionary thinking thrives in an environment of curiosity, creativity and necessity. This is why the Global South Thought Leadership Program was created, to provide a space for revolutionary thinking. By questioning established norms, we will open the door to innovative approaches and new paradigms through our Global South Project that have the power to shift not only individual lives but entire communities.

## Reflecting on Revolutionary Ideas

- **Can you think of revolutionary ideas from the past?**
- **How have those ideas impacted our lives?**
- **What lessons can we draw from these revolutionary moments?**

From the invention of the printing press to independence movements, groundbreaking ideas have changed how we view ourselves and our societies. The electricity, democracy, and the internet are just a few examples of innovations that fundamentally altered the course of human history. We need to explore some of these pivotal moments in history and gain inspiration for our Global South Project.

By studying the impacts of revolutionary ideas, we can understand how they address underlying societal needs. This insight can help us identify opportunities for innovation in the world today.

## Rethinking Education

Education is typically associated with academic achievement and socioeconomic progress—obtaining good grades, certifications or degrees to get well paying jobs in certain professions.  

**Question:** What is education and what is it for?

Digital education is challenging us to rethink education and the role it plays in our lives.

**Digital Education:**

- Social media
- E-textbooks
- Online courses and on-demand learning
- Cost and time efficient
- Self-learning
- Removes geographic restrictions
- Promotes accessibility and inclusivity for marginalized groups
- Encourages lifelong learning opportunities

**Question:** What else can we associate with digital education?

Education is foundational to thinking. The type of education we receive, whether formal or informal, teaches us how to see and interact with the world. So, what would be the consequences of [Western education](https://www.melbournemicrofinance.com/new-blog/2020/15/9/western-education-developing-countries) in post-colonial nations?&#x20;

There is a need to redefine education in the Global South. Education that can shape curiosity, creativity, ethics, empathy, and a sense of responsibility; empowering learners to build up their communities rather than extract from them.

## [Confucius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Confucius) Revolutionizes Chinese Culture

&#x20;

China was ruled by the Zhou (Chou) Dynasty until its fall around the 5th century BCE. This collapse led to the fragmentation of China into tribes and the eventual breakdown of central governance, giving rise to the Warring States period.

Society became unruly, and tribal factions were ruthless toward one another. Troubled by this violence, Confucius was determined to bring about a better way of life. 

### Who was Confucius?

- A civil servant turned teacher during China’s Warring States period (551 - 479 BCE).
- Recognized the chaos in society and sought to establish new traditions and customs to bring about harmony.
- Emphasized the importance of education as a tool for social and moral reform.



He realized that traditions and customs, which were disappearing, had the power to unite people and these shared practices could foster a sense of belonging and community.

Confucius saw that it was necessary to create new customs and traditions that honored and built upon the wisdom of the past. He created a life philosophy to end the suffering brought about by the Warring States period.

Initially, Confucius tried to promote his ideas as a civil servant, however, his proposals were largely ignored. Instead, he decided to become a teacher, reasoning that by educating enough students, his philosophy could spread. That is what happened!

Although Confucius did not see the widespread success of his teachings during his lifetime, his ideas gained significant influence years after his death up to today.&#x20;

### Key Teachings of Confucius

> **The goal of life is to be Chun Tzu, the Superior (Ideal) Person**
{: .prompt-tip }

> “There are three things constantly on the lips of the gentleman none of which I have succeeded in following: A man of benevolence never worries; a man of wisdom is never in two minds; a man of courage is never afraid” - The Analects, 14:28

**Ren (Jen): Benevolence**

The ultimate virtue is to love others.

> “If a man sets his heart on benevolence, he will be free from evil.” - The Analects, 4:4

Ren emphasizes compassion and empathy as guiding principles for human interaction, promoting the idea that kindness can create a ripple effect of positive change. This teaching underscores the interconnectedness of individuals and the broader society.

**Li & Xiao: Proper Conduct and Family Reverence**

Respect for five key relationships:

1. Ruler - Subject
2. Parent - Child
3. Husband - Wife
4. Elder Brother - Younger Brother
5. Elder Friend - Younger Friend

These relationships highlight the interconnected nature of society and the importance of fulfilling roles with respect and responsibility. A well-ordered society begins with harmonious relationships at every level.

**Doctrine of the Mean**

- Live in moderation.
- Strive not for excess.
- Value compromise.

This doctrine encourages balance in life, teaching individuals to avoid extremes and pursue harmony in personal and communal endeavors. It advocates for thoughtful decision-making and measured actions that benefit the collective.

**Wen: The Arts of Peace**

- Focus on activities that promote peace rather than conflict.
- Promoting peace includes confrontation when necessary, such as addressing poor leadership.

Wen advocates for the cultivation of arts, diplomacy, and moral integrity as tools for fostering societal well-being. This teaching encourages individuals to use their talents and creativity to uplift their communities.

### Key Insights from Confucius

- Education should teach individuals to master the art of peace (e.g., diplomacy, morality) rather than the art of war (e.g., conflict, profit-making).
- A cohesive society depends on the quality of relationships, underscoring the importance of mutual respect and shared values.
- **You are the sum of your relationships.** This philosophy fosters interconnectedness and social order, encouraging individuals to reflect on how their actions affect others.



> Teaching new philosophies can bring about drastic change.&#x20;

This insight from Confucius inspired the Global South Thought Leadership Program.  The teachings of Confucius remind us that education is not merely a means to an end but a transformative force for societal harmony.

By embracing Confucius’s revolutionary idea, we can learn to balance tradition with innovation, creating a world that values wisdom, respect, and compassion.

## The Revolution is in the Mind

> “The revolution will not be televised.”/ 
> — Gil Scott-Heron

Revolutionary thinking emphasizes mental transformation as the catalyst for societal change. True revolutions begin within—by challenging internalized beliefs and fostering new ways of understanding the world.

Revolutionary thinking also demands patience and resilience. Transformative ideas often face resistance, but history shows that persistence and collective effort can overcome obstacles, leading to lasting change.

To cultivate revolutionary thinking, we must commit to continuous self-improvement and the pursuit of knowledge. This mental revolution lays the groundwork for meaningful action that benefits individuals and society as a whole.
