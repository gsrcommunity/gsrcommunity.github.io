# Introduction

## Welcome to the Journey!

This introduction sets the foundation for your growth as a Global South Thought Leader (GS-TL). Whether you’re a researcher, a problem solver, or simply someone who wants to make a positive impact, this program is designed to help you think critically & creatively, act wisely,  and empower others.

## &#x20;Code of Conduct and Establishing Norms

Start with understanding the guidelines for respectful and productive discussions. These can be found at [GSR Community Conduct Policy](https://sites.google.com/view/gsrcommunity/home/conduct-policy).

## Who is a GS Thought Leader?

A thought leader is someone who offers unique perspectives, drives innovation, and inspires others to act. A GS Thought Leader embraces these qualities while  addressing  the unique challenges facing their local communities in the Global South.&#x20;

Since the problems that face the Global South are not only complex, but also deep-rooted and not well understood, we will need new skillsets to solve them. In particular, we will need to be:

- **Great teachers** who empower others
- **Versatile Researchers** who are resourceful and can leverage different kinds of knowledge

Most importantly, we will need to gain ***wisdom***. We will talk more about wisdom in a bit.&#x20;

Without wisdom, we won't be able to uncover a new path forward for the Global South and will instead risk perpetuating approaches that fail to address the root causes of challenges. Wisdom enables us to think deeply, innovate responsibly, and create thoughtful solutions for generational progress. 



### Traditional Thinking vs. GS Thought Leadership

- **Traditional:** Focuses on solving surface-level problems and implementing the solution.
- **GS-TL:** Asks deeper questions and involves the community in identifying and solving their challenges.

**Example Problem**: *A community in the Global South lacks access to clean drinking water and has bad waste management.*

- **Traditional**: Declares "This is a problem," and communicates a directive to the community: "We need to do this to solve the problem!"
- &#x20;**GS-TL**: Engages with the community by asking, "Is this the problem?" and collaboratively works with them to say, "Here is what we identify as the problem and here is a potential solution."

A GS Thought Leader approaches challenges by seeking context and what the community perceives as their problem before concluding what the actual problem is. For instance, if the pollution stems from mining activities that also provide well-paying jobs, the issue may not mainly be the lack of clean water but the community’s willingness to trade clean water and environmental health for economic benefits. In this case, the problem becomes the community's approach to solving economic issues. A GS-TL would shed more light on the consequences of their current approach—such as lower life expectancy, poor health, and higher expenses—and empower the community with alternative approaches to solving their economic issues.



### The WoW Thought Process

| **Process**     | **Definition**                                                                        | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data**        | *Observations* - the action of observing something carefully.                         | *You notice that most of the birds feed early in the morning, around sunrise, and prefer the northern side of the park where there are more trees.*                                    |
| **Information** | *Representation* - the description or portrayal of something in a particular way.     | *Most feeding activity occurs between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM.*                                                                                                                            |
| **Knowledge**   | *Causation* - a thing that gives rise to an action, phenomenon, or condition.         | *You discover that the birds feed early in the morning because food sources like insects are more active and abundant at sunrise.*                                                     |
| **Wisdom**      | *Edification* - the instruction or improvement of a person morally or intellectually. | *You start to understand the importance of preserving natural habitats and feeding behaviors and realize how small actions, like not littering, can positively impact local wildlife.* |

The problem with the traditional thought process is that there is a tendency to take the data as given and unbiased.&#x20;

Where does data come from? From **human** observation. Our mind collects data all the time in our memory, some we may record on paper or digitally so we don't forget. 

So data comes from humans, and it is biased based on what that person thinks is important to observe, remember and record.  

In the example above, perhaps the only reason someone gains these observations from the birds is because they believe birds are important and add to our life somehow. This is *wisdom* that is dictating the data that we observe.&#x20;

Cognitive processes are biased. We see the data that we want to see or are taught to see. So to see things differently will take wisdom.&#x20;

This journey requires recognizing and understanding biases, as they shape how we perceive the world, and embracing new perspectives. For example, the [Wright Brothers achieved human flight](https://www.nps.gov/wrbr/learn/historyculture/theroadtothefirstflight.htm) by rethinking [established knowledge](https://bigthink.com/pessimists-archive/air-space-flight-impossible/) and observing nature with fresh eyes.

## The GS Thought Leader Program Structure

Your development as a GS-TL will follow three key components:

1. **Global South Project:**
   - We work together to identify and solve a real problem in your community.
   - Develop practical leadership and research skills by putting GS Thought Leadership to action.
2. **Six Stages:**
   - Multidisciplinary GS Thought Leadership training in six stages:
     - Stage 0: Revolutionary Thinking
     - Stage 1: Creative and Critical Thinking
     - Stage 2: Contextual Knowledge
     - Stage 3: Technical Skills
     - Stage 4: Academic Knowledge
     - Stage 5: Social Skills
3. **Extracurricular Activities:**
   - Other activities such as discussions, invited guest speakers, and more. The activity and frequency depends on group attendance.



### Learning Through Teaching Activities

>“While we teach, we learn.” - Seneca &#x20;

A key part of this program is teaching and mentoring others. You will need to seek new perspectives and ideas to share with everyone and give constant feedback to others, mentoring them throughout this journey.

&#x20;Through teaching assignments, you will:

- Gain new insights.
- Sharpen your ability to communicate novel ideas.
- Receive feedback to continuously improve.

By mentoring through feedback tasks, you will:

- Improve active listening skills.
- Train critical thinking.
- Learn how to guide and improve others around you. 



### We Are A Team!

Teamwork and leadership is practiced within this program. We will not only build collaboration skills but also fosters individual growth by encouraging accountability, mutual support, and shared learning experiences.

**Team Leader:** We will split into two teams, each having a team leader.&#x20;

Team leaders will have to:&#x20;

- Provide direction for their team.
- Organize their teammates and help them progresh the program—lead them through assignments, help them with their project, organize team activities, and possibly more.

**Responsibilities:** Work closely with each other and practice leadership. Your responsibilities include:

1. Being a friend
2. Being a good friend
3. Being a great friend

Take time to connect and create a team name—this is your support system throughout the program.

## What’s Next?

Your first milestone is **Stage Zero: Revolutionary Thinking.**  This is the beginning of your journey as a GS Thought Leader—a path of wisdom, empowerment, and impactful change.



**Questions to think about:**

- Can you think of some revolutionary ideas of the past? How have those ideas impacted our lives?
- Characteristics of digital education?
- What is education? What is it for?
