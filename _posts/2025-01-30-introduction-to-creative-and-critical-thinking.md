# Stage 1 
## Thinking About Thinking
In this stage, we explore the foundations of **thinking**, essential  for understanding who we are and the world around us. We will discover that thinking is not just about rationality, but also about agency. In other words, we have the power to both understand the world and create it through thinking. 

Ask yourself:

- How do I naturally approach problems?
- Do I think creatively or logically?
- How much do I consider emotions in my thought processes?

These questions help you understand how you think.

### Here's a Scenario

Imagine you’re working with a community group on a health awareness campaign in a rural area in the Global South, where there’s skepticism around medical information from outside sources. During a meeting, an elder in the community—a respected figure everyone listens to—expresses strong doubts about the campaign, suggesting that it may not respect their traditions or fully consider their needs. The elder also warns the community against trusting "outsiders."

**How do you react in this situation?**

*Think about how you would apply critical thinking, creative thinking and emotional intelligence to this situation.*

## Play?

*Why do we play? For fun? Why is it fun?*

**Play** allows us to explore new ways of thinking, free from immediate consequences. It actively engages us in philosophical thought experiments, helping us reflect on knowledge, reality, and existence. It is temporary, like daydreaming.

Your ability to play, to change who you are in the world and create new values is your **creative thinking**. Assessing these values is your **critical thinking**.

For example, consider boxing. You are now playing the role of a boxer. You value hitting your opponent and not getting hit. To change yourself into a boxer takes quite a bit of creative thinking, you might become a totally different person. Additionally, you have to apply critical thinking given these new values as you try to figure out the best way to hit your opponents.

What begins as temporary, inconsequential play can become deeply transformative. What you play can become a part of what it means to be you. Think of ***all*** the roles you play: Student, parent, friend, son, daughter, doctor, artist, teacher, athlete,...

## What is Creative Thinking?

*You are! Think about this: your mind creates you.* 

Creative thinking is about making viable to yourself a new way of being, becoming a new person.

**Three Definitions of Creativity:**

1. The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.

2. Manifesting beyond your ordinary world by bringing to life something beyond ordinary beliefs, assumptions, habits, perceptions, and approaches.

3. Manifesting beyond your conditioned stories, beyond the story you are told or tell yourself.&#x20;

> Remember, creativity is not objective! Creativity is about you:
- Ideas and insights that are creative to **YOU**.
- Improvisation.
- Artistry of **YOUR** life. (possibilities and choices)&#x20;
{: .prompt-tip }

So, one trait you need to be creative is a willingness to be different and consistently change who you are. It is not enough to have a new idea, you have to be willing to manifest it and let that idea shape a new you.

**Tools for Creative Thinking:**

- Brainstorming
- Prototyping
- Questioning mindset
- Open-mindedness

## What is Critical Thinking?

Critical thinking involves determining the value of things by making judgments about whether something is:

- True or false.
- The best or worst of all known possible actions or ideas.
- The most or least probable event.

We rely on information, logic and ethics to determine value.

**Tools for Critical Thinking:**

- Research and analysis
- Compare and contrast
- Critique and justify
- Feedback and evaluation

## Fear?

*Why do we fear some things but not other things?*

Fear is a restraint on play. It is to engage in a  nature of knowledge, reality, and existence that respects the thing that you fear. So, what it means to be you is always in relation to what you fear. It limits your play because some play becomes too consequential to your being or livelihood.

Think about boxing again. A lot of people cannot "play" boxing because they are afraid of hitting someone or getting hit.&#x20;

So through limiting play, fear restricts our creative and critical thinking by limiting our willingness to explore new ways of being.

However, fear can be a good thing. There are things that are too valuable to us that we do not want to risk losing, there are consequences in life. For example, we should be afraid of the consequences of hitting people and getting hit.  

What is most important is that we don't allow fear to dictate our thinking. We need to think critically to help us decide which fears are worth respecting and creatively to overcome our fears.

## What is Thinking?

Thinking can be approached from both **bottom-up** and **top-down** perspectives:

**Bottom-Up:**&#x20;

- neurons (stimulation)&#x20;
- ideas (concepts)&#x20;
- experiences (environment)

**Top-Down:**&#x20;

- spiritual (transcendence)&#x20;
- consciousness (ethics)
- evolution (survival)

Our cognitive capacity is limited, we can't know everything. So ultimately, **what we value** is what shapes our thinking. Ask yourself: what is worthy of your attention? What is important, deserving, or useful to you?

## Final Thoughts

> "We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world."\
> — Buddha

Play is absolutely necessary for us to master as Global South Thought Leaders. We need to embrace play and be playful in all aspects of our life, including the Global South Project, if we want to be creative and revolutionary thinkers. Through play can we bring to life new values, ways of being, and a new world.

What's more, we need to think of ways to help people overcome fear. In a sense, we are going to ask people to play with us, to imagine and embrace a new way of being in the world through our Global South Project. For that to happen our project will need to make participating in our project viable to others by addressing their fears. 

By embracing play and examining fear, we unlock new ways of thinking and the potential to foster transformative change in ourselves and our communities.

## What's Next?

We will train our creative and critical thinking skills through philosophy first and then mathematical thinking.

These disciplines will help us understand  perspectives, confront current ways of thinking, and develop new ways of thinking grounded in wisdom.

Proceed to **Stage 1: Philosophy**.

**Questions to think about:**

- What is life truly about, and how do we find meaning in it?
- How do we know what's real and what's just an illusion?&#x20;
- How do we confirm knowledge? In other words, how do we know that what we know is true?&#x20;
- How do we decide what actions are right and wrong, and why do they matter?
